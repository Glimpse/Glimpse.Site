            <h2>Our Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>Glimpse has many different extensions and plugins. The Glimpse team works on general plugins for ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC, but there's a good chance that additional extensions are available for other components you are using. The owners of frameworks or applications on top of ASP.NET may provide their own plugins to allow insight into the server.</p>
            <p>Below is a list of all the different extensions that you have to choose from on NuGet. If you want something that isn't there, why not suggest it on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/getglimpse-dev" target="_blank">Google group</a>? </p>

            <h2>Creating Plugins</h2>
            <p>Many of our users get the best out of Glimpse by writing their own plugins, exposing data which is really only meaningful for their own applications.  One of the core tenets of Glimpse is that developers of any experience level should be able to make a custom extension simply and easily. </p>
            <p>Implementing a Glimpse Tab in your project will give a new tab in the Glimpse UI. Once the Tab has been created, assuming Glimpse has already been added to the project, we will automatically find the Tab and show its data.</p>
