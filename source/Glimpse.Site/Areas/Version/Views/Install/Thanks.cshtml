        <h2>Introducing HUD - Head Up Display</h2>
        <p>The Glimpse team, in conjunction with many members of the community, is proud to announce Glimpse Heads-Up Display (HUD) – a mini dashboard that pulls out the most important details about a request and displays it right in the bottom of your page.</p>
        <p>This release signals the biggest change to Glimpse since going live just over 2 years ago. We are very excited about this release and hope that it will help change the way you do development.</p>

        <p>HUD is almost ready to go and is in the final stages of development. We would love your help in getting some feedback about what we have produced. If you have some spare time to help out, please contact us on twitter:</p>
